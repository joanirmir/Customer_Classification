# Customer_Segmentation
Multi-class Classification Model to predict the label of new customers

Context:
An automobile company has plans to enter new markets with their existing products. After intensive market research, theyâ€™ve deduced that the behavior of new market is similar to their existing market.
In the existing market they classified customers into 4 segments. They plan to use the same strategy on new markets and have identified 2627 new potential customers.

Data Description:
Multi-class classification supervised ML model
Data is divided in train set (11 columns/ 8068 rows) and test set (10 columns/ 2627 rows)
Target variable: Segmentation-Column
Description of the problem: new customers are not yet labeled
Objective: create a prediction model that can assign the new customers to one of the existing segmentation (A,B,C,D) with high accuracy


Project Plan

Wed 2.Mar

1. EDA 
explore train set: column/features
checking for imbalance of target column
visualization of the data for understanding it better)

2. Data Cleaning
removing duplicates
dropping unnecessary columns: ID
dealing with missing values
numerical: Work_Experience: 829/around 10% (How to deal with the nan values here?), Family_Size: 335
categorical: Graduated: 78(Replacing with mode - Yes), Profession: 124 (Replacing with mode - Artist, Var_1: 76 (Replacing with mode - Cat_6), Ever_Married: 140 (Replacing with mode - Yes)

Still to do
removing duplicates
dropping unnecessary columns: ID
saving the cleaned version to a csv

3. Modelling
Split Train Data into Train and Validation Data with Predictors/Independent & Target/Dependent (Segmentation)
Encoding categorical variables - nominal or ordinal?
Pipeline 
Iteration: Choosing the best model with the highest accuracy and create the segmentation for the new customers
Feature Engineering (Feature Importance/ Feature Selection)
